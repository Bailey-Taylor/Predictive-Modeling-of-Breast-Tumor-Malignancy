# Predictive Modeling of Breast Tumor Malignancy
## Introduction
According to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer stands as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Given its severity, early detection is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of predicting breast tumor malignancy using morphological and textural features of tumor cells, utilizing data from the University of Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset.
## Data Description
The dataset consists of measurements of ten features computed for each cell nucleus: radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension. The mean, standard error, and worst (mean of the three largest values) was calculated for each of these features, resulting in 30 variables. For this study, only the mean of each feature was utilized, leaving 10 predictor variables. Additionally, the dataset contains the target variable: diagnosis (malignant or benign) and a patient ID column. Measurements of cell nuclei from 569 patients was recorded, with 212 malignant and 357 benign diagnoses.
## Methods
### Random Forest Classification
Random Forest is employed as an ensemble learning method, combining multiple decision trees for robust predictions. This method is effective in capturing complex relationships within the data and provides valuable insights into variable importance. The model's performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve.
### Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification
SVM is utilized for classification, finding the hyperplane that best separates data into different classes. SVM's performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the Receiver Operating Curve (ROC). Despite its sensitivity to outliers, SVM proves effective in high-dimensional spaces, making it suitable for various applications.
## Results
The results of the predictive modeling for breast tumor malignancy using Random Forest and SVM algorithms showcase strong performance. The Random Forest model, built on 500 decision trees, demonstrated an accuracy of 94.47% on the training set and 91.81% on the test set, with notable variable importance, including concave points. The SVM model, tuned with a cost value of 3 and a radial kernel, outperformed the Random Forest, achieving an accuracy of 96.73% on the training set and 95.91% on the test set. Both models exhibited low error rates, precision, recall, and F1-scores, emphasizing their potential for predicting breast tumor malignancy.
